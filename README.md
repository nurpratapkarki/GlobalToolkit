##  Why DevToolkit?

In the modern workflow, developers often find themselves bouncing between multiple online tools—most of which are bloated, ad-ridden, or just plain slow. DevToolkit was built to fix that.

It’s:
- **Frontend-only**: No backend, no servers, no data tracking.
- **Blazingly fast**: Powered by Vite + React for instant load and zero lag.
- **Modular**: Add new tools as you go, easily maintainable and scalable.
- **Offline-ready**: Works as a standalone static app — deploy anywhere.
- **Clean & minimal**: No ads, no fluff, just tools.
